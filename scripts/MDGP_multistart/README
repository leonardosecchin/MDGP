To run tests, execute from Julia

> include("tests.jl")
> run_multistart()

This will parse all PDB IDs listed in 'selected_probs' and then apply 'MDGP_multistart'
with the default parameters. The results are stored in the 'RESULTS' file.

Please make sure all necessary packages are installed in your Julia, including
MDGP (https://github.com/leonardosecchin/MDGP.git).

Tests can be ran in parallel. To do this, open Julia specifying the number of threads:
julia -t [NUMBER OF THREADS]

The PDB parser (pdb_parser.py) was created by Wagner da Rocha. For more information and
